# DES_AES_RSA_comparison
DES (Data Encryption Standard), AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) are all cryptographic algorithms used for encryption and decryption in various applications. This repository contains the comparisons between them.

## Note

In this I have used three different files named: 50mb.txt, 10mb.txt, and 600kb.txt. First create these files with random text and same naming then run the python provided jupyter notebook file. You will see the results.
